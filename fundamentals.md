## Concepts
- Scalability: grow horizontally (add servers) vs vertically (add power)
- Reliability (not vulnerable) vs Availability (be available)
- Efficiency: latency and bandwidth
- Serviceability/Manageability: easy to debug and patch
- Load Balancing (help horizontally adding servers): distribute traffic and stop requests when server's down
  - Can be added in 3 cases: ![load-balancer.png](img%2Fload-balancer.png)
  - LB algorithms: LCM, LRTM, LBM, RR, WRR, IP Hash https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/types-of-load-balancing-algorithms/
  - Redundant LB: use 2 lb as a cluster to handle single failure of point
- Caching: (vertically, normally used in frontend): latest requested data is likely to be requested again
  - Application Server Cache: local storage (local memory or disk) of response data 
    - To avoid cache miss, use global cache or distributed cache
  - Content Distribution Network (CDN)
